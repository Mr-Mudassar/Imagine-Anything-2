                <p>
                    (a) We offer a variety of memberships, as set out on our
                    Site, to give you instant access to generate and download
                    images (Membership). You may purchase a Membership by paying
                    the Membership Fee outlined on the Site (Membership Fee) in
                    advance, at the interval you choose at the time of sign-up
                    (usually monthly or annually) (Billing Cycle).
                </p>
                <p>
                    (b) Your Membership will automatically renew at the end of
                    the Billing Cycle for the same period of time and you will
                    be charged the Membership Fee in connection with each
                    subsequent Billing Cycle unless and until you cancel your
                    Membership.

                    Changes to your Membership
                </h2>
                <p>
                    (c) If you wish to change your Membership (for example, by
                    upgrading to a different Membership tier), you must provide
                    notice to us through your Account that you wish to vary your
                    Membership before the end of the current Billing Cycle. If
                    you vary your Membership and the Fees increase, we will
                    charge you the new Membership Fees (less any unused fees for
                    the previous month, deducted on a pro-rata basis) and you
                    will have access to the additional Membership features from
                    the date you make such payment (which will become your new
                    Billing Cycle). If you downgrade your Membership to a lower
                    tier, then you will retain access to your current Membership
                    until the end of that Billing Cycle, and the downgrade will
                    commence the following Billing Cycle. If you wish to change
                    your Billing Cycle, you can do this through your Account,
                    however a pro rata fee may be charged to account for any
                    difference in payment dates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (d) We may need to change what is available as part of your
                    Membership (for example, the inclusions, exclusions, updated
                    features) from time to time. If we change what is available
                    as part of your Membership, we will provide you with at
                    least 30 days’ notice of the change. After the notice period
                    has lapsed, we will apply the changes to your Membership. If
                    the changes adversely affect your enjoyment of the
                    Membership, you may cancel your Membership with effect from
                    the date we apply the changes to your Membership by
                    providing written notice to us. If you cancel your
                    membership: (1) you will no longer be able to use your
                    Membership on and from the date of cancelation; and (2) if
                    you have paid Membership Fees upfront you will be issued a
                    pro-rata refund having regard to the date of termination and
                    the period for which you have paid.
                </p>
                (e) We may need to change the Membership Fees from time to time.
                If we change the Membership Fees, we will provide you with 30
                days’ notice of the change. After 30 days, we will apply the
                updated Fee to your Membership and it will apply from the next
                Billing Cycle. If the updated Membership Fee is not acceptable
                to you, you may cancel your Membership in accordance with clause
                4(j).

                    downloads from other users), we may temporarily suspend
                    access to your Membership. In this case, we will give you
                    notice of this, and if you do not adjust your usage in line

                    Vary the Membership Fees to reflect your increased use of

                    written notice of the new Membership Fees; or terminate
                    these Terms immediately, in which case: (1) you will no
                    longer be able to use your Membership on and from the date
                    of our termination; and (2) if you have paid Membership Fees

                    will either repair the damage or pay you compensation.

                    have avoided by following our advice to apply an update

                    by you failing to correctly follow installation instructions

                    download images or sign up to a Membership as a business, or
                    in a commercial capacity neither Party will be liable for

                    was caused or contributed to by the acts or omissions of the
                    other party, including any failure by that other party to
                    mitigate its loss; and our aggregate liability for any
                    Liability arising from or in connection with these Terms
                    will be limited to us resupplying the images or Membership

                    Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms, nothing
                    in these Terms confers or is intended to confer any right to

                    operate to prevent us or you from seeking urgent injunctive
                    or equitable relief from a court of appropriate
                    jurisdiction.
                </p>

                    refer the matter to mediation, administered by The Centre

                    resident or incorporated in England and Wales, refer the
