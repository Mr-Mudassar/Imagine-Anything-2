                    <p>
                        You have the right to request that we erase all personal
                        data we have about you, and we must respond to that
                        request without undue delay. There are some conditions
                        that apply with this right, but we will make every
                        attempt to respond to a &quot;Right to be
                        Forgotten&quot; request within 30 days or receiving it.

                    <p>
                        This one is fairly straight forward; if you notice that
                        the data we have about you is inaccurate or incomplete,
                        you may request we rectify the mistake. We will make
                        every effort to respond to requests of this type
                        immediately.
