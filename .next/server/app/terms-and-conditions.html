By doing so you authorise us to access basic contact information including your name and email address.</p><p>You must ensure that any personal data you give to us when creating an account is accurate and up-to-date.</p><p>It is your responsibility to keep your account details confidential. You are responsible for all activity on your account, including generations and downloads made using your account details (whether from your staff or otherwise).</p><p>We may suspend your access to your Account where we reasonably believe there has been any unauthorized access to or use of our Site (such as the unauthorized sharing of login details for our Site) and your access to your Membership will end (if you have an active Membership).</p></section><section><h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl">3. Memberships</h2><h3>General</h3><p>(a) We offer a variety of memberships, as set out on our Site, to give you instant access to generate and download images (Membership). You may purchase a Membership by paying the Membership Fee outlined on the Site (Membership Fee) in advance, at the interval you choose at the time of sign-up (usually monthly or annually) (Billing Cycle).</p><p>(b) Your Membership will automatically renew at the end of the Billing Cycle for the same period of time and you will be charged the Membership Fee in connection with each subsequent Billing Cycle unless and until you cancel your Membership.</p></section><section><h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl">Changes to your Membership</h2><p>(c) If you wish to change your Membership (for example, by upgrading to a different Membership tier), you must provide notice to us through your Account that you wish to vary your Membership before the end of the current Billing Cycle. If you vary your Membership and the Fees increase, we will charge you the new Membership Fees (less any unused fees for the previous month, deducted on a pro-rata basis) and you will have access to the additional Membership features from the date you make such payment (which will become your new Billing Cycle). If you downgrade your Membership to a lower tier, then you will retain access to your current Membership until the end of that Billing Cycle, and the downgrade will commence the following Billing Cycle. If you wish to change your Billing Cycle, you can do this through your Account, however a pro rata fee may be charged to account for any difference in payment dates.</p><p>(d) We may need to change what is available as part of your Membership (for example, the inclusions, exclusions, updated features) from time to time. If we change what is available as part of your Membership, we will provide you with at least 30 days’ notice of the change. After the notice period has lapsed, we will apply the changes to your Membership. If the changes adversely affect your enjoyment of the Membership, you may cancel your Membership with effect from the date we apply the changes to your Membership by providing written notice to us. If you cancel your membership: (1) you will no longer be able to use your Membership on and from the date of cancelation; and (2) if you have paid Membership Fees upfront you will be issued a pro-rata refund having regard to the date of termination and the period for which you have paid.</p>(e) We may need to change the Membership Fees from time to time. If we change the Membership Fees, we will provide you with 30 days’ notice of the change. After 30 days, we will apply the updated Fee to your Membership and it will apply from the next Billing Cycle. If the updated Membership Fee is not acceptable to you, you may cancel your Membership in accordance with clause 4(j).</section><section><h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl">4 Fair Use</h2><p>(i) Where you have purchased a Membership that gives you access to unlimited downloads of images, you agree that where you continuously or frequently download images of a volume or effort level that is substantially greater than average (based on the data we gather from requests and downloads from other users), we may temporarily suspend access to your Membership. In this case, we will give you notice of this, and if you do not adjust your usage in line with any request to do so, we may:</p><p>Vary the Membership Fees to reflect your increased use of our limited resources, effective on and from us giving you written notice of the new Membership Fees; or terminate these Terms immediately, in which case: (1) you will no longer be able to use your Membership on and from the date of our termination; and (2) if you have paid Membership Fees upfront you will be issued a pro-rata refund having regard to the date of termination and the period for which you have paid.</p><h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl">15 Definitions</h2></section><section><h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl">Cancellation</h2><p>(j) You may request to cancel your Membership at any time by visiting your membership page and clicking cancel membership.
